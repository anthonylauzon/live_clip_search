Live Clip Search
================

Info
----

One of the features lacking in Ableton Live is the ability to search for clips
by name and then trigger them.  This project aims to provide this functionality 
to Ableton Live users until Ableton includes this feature in a future release.

Requirements
------------

To use this project you'll need to have LiveOSC installed as a MIDI remote
script and enabled as a control surface in Live.  You can get LiveOSC here:

http://monome.q3f.org/wiki/LiveOSC

You'll also need to have the LiveOSC directory somewhere on your PYTHONPATH.

Usage
---------------------

The project has a simple Tk GUI front end and should be relatively
straightforward to use.  Type in a search pattern to return a list of result
clips.  Double click a clip to trigger it in Live.
